# CO2 Meter with ESP32

## Description

Messasure CO2 particles in to the air.
Warns when you should ventilate the room.

You find an video documentary (in german) on my Youtube channel:

## Features

- Measure CO2 concentration in room
- MQTT support (for Node-Red or Home Assistant)
- easy integration in own WiFi network (Hotspot settings-page)
- OLED display: can used independently thanks to the measured values shown on the display

## Wiring

### CO2 sensor (MH-Z14A)

| Pin on Sensor | description | Pin on ESP32                     |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 16            | GND         | GND                              |
| 17            | Power (5V)  | VIN (can also used as 5V output) |
| 18            | UART RXD    | GPIO17 (UART 2 TX)               |
| 19            | UART TXD    | GPIO16 (UART 2 RX)               |

### OLED display (SSD1306)

| Pin on Sensor | description  | Pin on ESP32     |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| GND           | GND          | GND              |
| VCC           | Power (3.3V) | 3V3              |
| SCL           |              | GPIO22 (I2C SCL) |
| SDA           |              | GPIO21 (I2C SDA) |

## Setup

- connect all parts to the ESP32
- connect power
- the ESP32 starting an own Wifi access point named "co2-meter-{device ID}"
- connect to this Wifi with your smartphone
- use `waaatering` for Wifi password
- you will redirected to a config page
- insert your Wifi and MQTT broker credentials
- click on "save"
- the ESP32 will restarting and connect to your MQTT broker
- after about 60 seconds should you should see a new topic in your MQTT broker `co2-meter/{device ID}/out/info` with a lot of information in the payload

## MQTT API

The whole module is controllable via MQTT protocol. So it's easy to integrate in existing SmartHome systems (like Home Assistant or Node-Red).

## Housing

You can create a robust housing with a 3D printer or at the workbench.

I decided to make one out of plywood. It didn't turn out perfect, but it protects the components.
